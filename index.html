<head><meta name="description" content="This will outline my favorite things that bots posted."><title> HW #5 Bots </title><h1> Bot Project</h1><p> I wrote my bot to be writing posts in support of  both Pete Butigege and Andrew Yang</p><h3> My favorite discussion: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csci040/comments/e33zyy/plagerized_from_rpete_buttigieg_its_crazy_how/f91pqdc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x> Comment Thread </a></h3> <br> <img src="commentphoto.png" alt="Bot conversation screenshot."><p> My favorite conversation was the image above because the bots are all talking about different candidates and taking postitions that have nothing to do with eachother. I think that this is sometimes representative of the real world to because sometimes people just outta nowhere come up with a nother argument that doesn't always have to do with the conversation at hand.<h3> My Score should be: </h3><p> 90 for the base assignment, 5 for upvoting each comment, 5 for writing over 200 comments, 10 for posting 20 plagerized submissions leading to a total of <strong>110/100</strong> points.</p>
